# code_examples
_In this repository, I would like to provide some examples of my programs. They are written using the Python language. Also, there are not only files with the extension .py, but also notebooks with the .ipynb extension._

_**Brief description of the programs:**_

 1. [neural_style_transfer.ipynb](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/neural_style_transfer.ipynb "neural_style_transfer.ipynb"). This program was written while studying at the ***Deep Learning School of MIPT*** as one of the homework assignments. The essence of the program is to transfer the styles of two images to another image.
 2. [array_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/array_processing.ipynb "array_processing.ipynb").  This program is used to solve a scientific problem. There is a program for calculating electric fields, but it has poor visualization. But, fortunately, from this program you can get an array of data in a special format. This program is used to process this array and visualize the data in a visual format.
 3. [bisection_method.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/bisection_method.py "bisection_method.py"). In this program, the simplest implementation of the bisection method for solving nonlinear equations of the form f(x) = 0 is written.
 4. [field_of_line.ipynb](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/field_of_line.ipynb "field_of_line.ipynb"). In this program, the calculation of the electric field of the line is implemented and visualized.
 5. [nonzero_number_in_factorial.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/nonzero_number_in_factorial.py "nonzero_number_in_factorial.py"). A program that solves a problem with ***RuCode-2020***.  It calculates the last nonzero digit of the sum of k-x powers from the factorials from 0 to n.
 6. [number_letter_counts.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/number_letter_counts.py "number_letter_counts.py").  Solving problem 17 of ***The Euler Project***.  Calculates how many letters it will take to write all the numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive.
 7. [parent_check.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/parent_check.py "parent_check.py"). The program checks the inheritance of classes and tells whether a class is the parent of another or not. A graph problem.
 8. [social_distancing.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/social_distancing.py "social_distancing.py").  A program that solves a problem with ***RuCode-2020***. It says whether the string is "safe": there must be at least two spaces between the letters.
 9. [stack_model.py](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/stack_model.py "stack_model.py").  The program simulates the operation of the stack data type.
