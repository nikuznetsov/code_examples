Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on?, I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acappella
I could give you want you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)
Drunk kickin', dutch lickin', he said he can't fuck with me
Fuck this and fuck with me, I'ma take your luck with me
Bitch, what the fuck it do? TeamSESH drippin' on the 1s and the 2s
Fuck your crew and and fuck you too
Edge of the swamp, know the truck go through

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I know that it hurts sometimes, but It's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wan' see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feeling philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, will you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
Comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all

Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for it

I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong then I make another song

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone

You wanna run that shit back for me?

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it,you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch

I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They asking me how it feel,I say it's crazy

When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..

If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..

But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..

You notice me
You know its me

It's me

My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you

Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl
I'm all on my own
I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Putting my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flying bitch
Breaking my bones
You breaking my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me cause it help me forget
I ain't go put up no time
If you ain't got time if I ain't gon' bitch
I'm doing my thing
and bitch I can see all the disrespect in front of my face
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smoking on something imo dip
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I wont pick up the phone
Just know that I need you

Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins

Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make her frumpet cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
Get my face recognised
We can do anything
Worth, greed, memory
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make a grown man cry cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be

Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you

(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u

Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
What if I end my fucking life

I'mma take my time when I'm in it
I'mma make my mind up by tonight
No I can't die when I'm singing
I could live forever, way past the mic

These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than..
See you leave just like the rest..
(See you leave just like the rest..)
Damn..

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me
I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie til' the sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my, nuts

Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me
I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie til' the sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my, nuts

My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all

I been spending time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But I just find I been lyin
Lying to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby I could handle mine
I could multiply..
I could satisfy..
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
That's the reason why
I been working hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe 

Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, hoe
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, hoe
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god
I been workin' like I never had a job
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door

See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, hoe

Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me

Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
But you got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burning down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(baby I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream
(baby I need you)

Ice in your veins
Blood in your brain
I feel your pain
I think we're going insane
I saw you today
And I thought I should say
That I still love u like I did back in two thousand and eight
Okay
Girl I got whatever you want right here
I ain't never letting you leave my dear
I'ma tie you up and I'ma lock you away
You don't ever listen to the shit that I say
I'ma make you listen to me
I'ma make you listen to me
Smoking on some loud
Out the motherfucking pound
I'ma give ya bitch a ounce for free..

Baby I could give u the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah It's true
Girl I think I'm dying real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Ima keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wasting my time
Giving you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

Smokin' and puttin' my lip on my bitches
They kissin' my dick while I'm typin' my digits
Arthritis inside of my digits from twistin' the piff
And yo' bitch think I'm trippin', I'm flippin' the script
And I'm flippin' prescriptions, my vision is blurry
My thoughts are perverted
I'm closing my curtains, and go in the furnace
And I bring my ruger to kill Freddie Kreuger, you loser
I'm basically what your bitch dream about
She wanna see me but she never see me out
And when she do, she gon' show me what she about
If you got something to say you can scream it out loud
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think
I got that drip, I think she wanna drink
I'll make it drip, where your pussy is pink
This is OmenXIII, fuck around with Lil Peep
Keep goin', she say she a fiend for it
Told me that you got that lean, pour it
I never step on the scene, boy
I never come out my tree like I'm pain
Hatin' on me like the leaves when it rain
I feed off the hate, it make me feel great
I'm stayin' up late, she giving me face
Get the fuck out my way when I'm after that cake

Back to the head, bitch I smoke it like I had to
Cracks in my head, like a motherfuckin' statue
Back to back with the lead, spittin' out the fuckin' barrel
Young white pharaoh in the back of the Camaro (Skrr)
Dopamine release, copin' with the freezer
With the coats made of geese, can you feel my energy
It's floatin' in the breeze, growin' with the trees
Wake up in the morning by the ocean on the beach, Peep
Take away my pain, feel my body up with love
See you landed in my bed, but you've fallen from above
Every time you give me head, got my body goin' numb
See you probably in your bed while I'm probably goin' dumb
On these beats, swervin' thru the streets (Damn)
Flip a couple packs and keep applying with the heat
Pressure cooker Peep, steppin' on your feet
Tell em rest in peace, cut your body to a piece, you deceased
Yellin' bitch I ain't a fool, and I just ain't you
You the type to take the red and I'm the type to take the blue
See I know it's just some paper, tryna get up out my room
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yuh
(But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yuh)
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food
Sippin' boba on the rocks got the Right strain too
In the East, in the West, what you need, we comin' through, bitch

I went to the store now I'm walking back
I took the same path as a psychopath
You tried to grab me and it was a bloodbath (What?)
Straight facts anyone of you can feel my wrath
I take acid to hallucinate (I'm trippin')
I cop a xan, I pop a xan and then I duplicate
Ayy, yo bitch listen when she masturbate (Pussy)
I eat her out, I smoke a blunt, it kill the aftertaste
Blacked out, yelling free that Gucci man, ho
Blacked out, when they shooting at the van, ho
Blacked out, you should pop another xan, ho
Blacked out, pop another for my man's, ho

Welcome to the underground, other underground
Pussy never come around, he don't like the sound
Lil Peep, OmenXIII, we hold it down
I can take that smile off your face and make you frown
Evil killer clown, creepin' in the sewer
I be laughing while I'm killing, like I barely even knew her
I'ma cut her up in pieces, leave that bitch inside the swamp
I'm the king over it so everybody knows what's up

I don't want to talk to you
Couldn't care less how you feelin' right now
I'm a ghost I can walk through you (walk through you)
All black blade with a dutch light brown
I'm a sixteen bar killer, none realer
LiL PEEP, OmenXIII, can't flow with us
Now you sellin' out shows and you fuckin' on a ho
But yo ass still know that we flow bigger
No job, no mob, no time, do it on my own time, on my own grind
Oh my, oh my, not a day go by where I don't get high
Write a hundred fuckin' rhymes
Fine, I'm better off without you on my mind
Do it like a mom only talking on my line
Then it's back to the bedroom, back to the lies
I'm bleedin' to death, but I'ma tell you that I'm fine
Bleedin' to death, but I'ma tell you that I'm fine
I'm doin' my best to keep the money on my mind
You thought I was weak man because I was being kind
You won't see the weekend, I leave em' in the pond

Breathe, stretch
Deep breath
Life, death
Smokin' these blunts to my neck 'til I go
Open my lungs and I resin my throat
Choke from the blunt while I flex on your ho
Smoke, smoke
Pass the gas and the lighter
Smack on that ass and I bite her
I'll make that pussy feel tighter
Blowin' my smoke at a spider
I'm gettin' bugs high
Bitch, I'm a swamp guy
I'll give you one shot
Bitch, take your best shot
I could really give a fuck about you people
Smokin' reefer like this shit don't make me evil
Meet the reaper while I'm burnin' down the steeple
Keep the beeper by the heater, that's illegal
Fuck what you thought
Fuck what you bought
Fuck what you drive
I'm fuckin' your mind
Scuffin' my kicks
I play for the Knicks
Cuts in my wrist
'Cause I know that nobody can fuck with this shit
I feel so alone, look at the clones
If your body dope but your mind in the gutter then don't call my phone
I'm good on my own
Blowin this dope out my throat what cho bitch won't stop watchin me fo?
I got your bitch moppin' the flow
I'm gettin' cancer, I'm gettin' cancer, I'm gettin' cancer, ho
I heard you be dancin', ho, don't make me wait, I won't answer, ho
Don't got the answers, don't got the answers, don't got the answers, ho
I am not fancy, I am not wealthy, bitch you can't talk 'bout my clothes

Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Everybody wanna get high
Middle fingers up in the sky
Everybody wanna get high, middle fingers to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna get high
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why

I hit the dope two time, take the stress off my mind
I hit the coast, and I ride, coming quick on your side
I'm like a ghost half the time, I'm just creepin' behind
I'm never slow, I follow, take your soul, you hollow
Bass kickin' like your bitch, kidnap her for kicks
Come 6, poppin' sticks, while she biting my lip
Don't flip, don't dip, better not move too quick
I take that grip right off your hip and smack yo' ass with the clip
Hollow tip spit, like a blue-nose pit
Hold my shit, I'ma fuck your bitch
Bump Three-6, while I cut my wrist
Funk my kicks, then I break the rim
When I dunk that shit, bloodstain the Timb
No shit, got razor blades in my fist, taking lists
Only time I put the blade down
When I gotta pick up my pen
Fuck your Benz, I'ma paint the Cadillac black
Can't see me in the night, with the lights off (nah)
Quicksand on the white walls
Living life on the edge, bitch, I might fall (might fall)
Don't give a fuck what they say about me (nope)
Peep won't rest 'till I rest in peace
S on my chest when I come up on the beat
Full moon flex while you motherfuckers sleep

Make my will, while I take my pills
Give your bitch chills, when I make my bills
If I get killed, I know I'ma die real
Stay real still, you already know the deal
You already know the deal
Lil Peep poppin' Henny bottles, fuck a seal
I love the way it feel, so I do it for the thrill
Say she wanna chill, bitch I know the fucking deal
(Fucking deal)

I've been letting my hair grow, your parents know
I'm the bad boy, I'm a scarecrow
I'm sagging my pants, let the brand show
These damn hoes schemin'
Got the brand on my hand, hoe
I come from the land where the xans go
Quicker than the coke
Raise your hands if you can't cope
With the damn cold, seven feet of snow
Whatchu need we got it, bleeding for deposits
Just bag it up and then you flip it for a sizable profit
The cops is on my dick, I'm bout to get this shit poppin'
I'm dropping out this bitch and making money off of my music
Now it's one year later, still broke, still stupid
Still smoke my tooka, rest in peace Martin Luther
But Freddy Kruger all I'm dreaming 'bout
I can't see my future
I can't see my feet, this shit gets darker when it's deep
But I can breathe underwater, ask your daughter
I'm a freak, Peep

I put my heart in this shit
I ripped the heart out the goat
Pull the blade out my coat
Cut your throat to the bone
On some Game of Thrones shit
I cannot fuck with no bitch
When she suckin' on somebody dick
That type of shit get me sick
I'm a prick but I don't fuck with bitches
That get my whole city whatever they want
If it's pussy, a lip on the tip of the dick
All of you wanna be rappers
But can't make no music to make that shit happen
And that's probably cause you just rap about trappin'
Or smackin' the next motherfucker that say that I act like I'm ballin'
All of y'all pussies is wack
Some of y'all pussies is rats
Half of y'all pussies is trash
And the other half of y'all is dying at night
What the fuck do that mean? Do the math
Step on the scene like the Hulk
Bitch, I'm green
Bitches on me, I'm the young Charlie Sheen
Rips in my jeans and my skin 'til I bleed
The reason you're losing your sleep is Lil Peep

Kill these motherfuckers, waiting patient for the flow to come
It's like I got some supernatural powers, I'm the chosen one
These bitches want me dead, I'm bustin' back
I got a golden gun inside my fuckin' hand
I pick a hater, put a hole in one
I been working, she been twerking on my fucking dick
Pussy perfect but she never got a compliment
I'm too busy stacking twenties cause my money spent
I got kicked out of the crib, I couldn't pay my rent
Young pussy, old pussy, come pussy go
Never stay the same with these motherfuckin' hoes
They be triflin' like "Why you ain't recycling for?"
Shut the fuck up bitch, I'll break my bottle right on the floor
I'm smokin' dope, I'm getting throat
This beat is wavy, I'm a boat
Bitch I hope you never know the shit I do when I'm alone
Hell is my home, and I ain't pickin' up my phone
Get the fuck out my zone, and watch yo motherfuckin' tone, bitch

Chilling by myself, I don't need nobody
Find me in the room just another fuckin' body
Dope on the spoon bitch, I'm looking like a zombie
I don't wanna move, you won't see me at the party

It's the king of the swamp (Who!)
Come out the mud with the bugs on my face
And the muck in my lungs
Tuck in my gun
Keep it under my tongue
When I open my mouth
Get to ducking and run
Sucking me up bitches stuck on my nuts
Cause I fuck 'em and bust on they face when I'm done
Lucky for us, she gon' act like a slut
I be making them sweat like they under the sun
I keep a felony on me wherever I go
When I don't got no strap
I keep my enemies close to me
They not my homies, I know for a fact
I keep my Hennessy open
I keep my bitch twerkin' like she in a bath
I keep the medicine rollin'
Like fuck where you going
I'm smoking a sack
Looking like a flight risk
Blood on the light switch
Don't get too close or you might get
Sliced with the knife I grip in my right fist
Catch me throwin' dick at a white bitch
Catch me gettin' lit like a light, bitch
Make slits in my wrist, fuck life
This don't mean shit to none of y'all listening
Sip blood from a goat at my christening
Ice flood like a boat, sea glistening
On my wrist why am I
Talking 'bout my wrist again?
Lil Peep write songs for the middleman
Get back to the seminar, never known
In my head, hear gunshots letting off
Stone cross [?] in the swamp moss
When the sun go down don't get lost
